.TH FBLOGIN 1 "2025-02-25" "fblogin v1.0" "User Login Interface"
.SH NAME
fblogin \- frame buffer–based graphical login wrapper for Debian systems

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fblogin
[\fI--cmatrix\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fbfblogin\fR is a minimalistic login replacement that operates directly on the Linux
frame buffer. It provides a visually enhanced login experience for tty1 by combining
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) based user authentication with optional fingerprint
verification (via fprintd), direct pixel manipulation of the Linux framebuffer, and a custom
graphical user interface.

The program is designed to be lightweight and modular, interfacing directly with system
resources such as the frame buffer (/dev/fb0), termios for raw input, and PAM for secure
authentication. In addition, fblogin offers an optional animated "cmatrix" background and
displays a Debian spiral (PFP) graphic as a central visual element.

.SH FRAMEBUFFER AND GRAPHICS
fblogin uses the Linux framebuffer interface to draw its user interface.  It opens the
framebuffer device, obtains screen resolution and color depth via FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO,
and maps the framebuffer memory into its address space using mmap(2). Custom routines are
provided to clear the screen, render individual pixels, draw filled and outline rectangles,
and render text using an 8×8 bitmap font scaled by a compile-time factor.  The program also
forces screen updates via msync(2) and FBIOPAN_DISPLAY to ensure that changes are visible
on all connected displays.

.SH PAM AUTHENTICATION
The authentication mechanism in fblogin is based on PAM, which allows for pluggable,
policy-driven authentication.  fblogin initializes a PAM session using pam_start(3) with the
service name \fBfblogin\fR and supplies a custom conversation function to pass non-interactive
password input to the underlying PAM modules. Calls to pam_authenticate(3) and
pam_acct_mgmt(3) ensure that the user credentials and account status are validated. This
approach abstracts the authentication details and ensures compliance with system security
policies.

.SH FPRINTD INTEGRATION
For systems equipped with fingerprint sensors, fblogin integrates with fprintd, the Linux
fingerprint daemon.  Upon entering a username, the program invokes \fBfprintd-list\fR to
determine if any fingerprints are enrolled for the user. If fingerprints are detected, it
then calls \fBfprintd-verify\fR with the appropriate finger parameter.  A successful
fingerprint verification bypasses the need for password entry.  If fingerprint authentication
fails or is unavailable, fblogin gracefully falls back to traditional password verification.

.SH USER INTERFACE
The user interface of fblogin is constructed entirely in software using direct framebuffer
access.  The interface comprises:
.IP "Base UI:"
A background which can be either static (black) or animated (cmatrix-style) when the
\fB--cmatrix\fR flag is provided.  The base UI also includes a title—"Login for \fI<hostname>\fR"
—rendered with a bubble-style outline and a centrally positioned Debian spiral (PFP)
graphic.
.IP "Input Fields:"
Outlined (transparent) rectangular boxes for the username and password are rendered below
the spiral.  The layout is adjustable via hardcoded vertical offsets, and the text is drawn
using a scaled 8×8 font.
.IP "Dynamic Behavior:"
Special keys (Ctrl‑D, Ctrl‑C, etc.) are trapped to allow for input editing and prompt
restarting.  The program’s internal state is updated dynamically based on user input.

.SH SYSTEM INTEGRATION
fblogin is intended to replace the default login prompt on tty1.  In modern systems, this
is typically managed by systemd via getty@tty1.service.  fblogin is designed to be launched
via a systemd drop‑in override which replaces the default ExecStart with the fblogin binary.
Upon successful authentication, the program transitions from the root‐managed login
environment to the authenticated user’s session by performing a series of system calls
(setuid, setgid, initgroups, setsid, chdir, and finally execv to launch the user’s shell).

.SH SHORTCOMINGS AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
While fblogin demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a frame buffer–based login system, it has
certain limitations:
.IP 1
The current cmatrix background is rudimentary and may be improved for smoother animation
and lower visual distraction.
.IP 1
The layout and scaling factors are hardcoded and may not be resolution-independent.
.IP 1
The program uses the legacy fbdev interface; future iterations may leverage DRM/KMS for
more robust display control.
.IP 1
Error handling and logging are minimal and could be enhanced for production environments.
.P
Future work may address these shortcomings, as well as add additional features such as
multi-factor authentication, theme support, and dynamic layout adaptation.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fB/etc/pam.d/fblogin\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM CALLS AND LIBRARIES
fblogin makes extensive use of Unix system calls and standard C library functions. It uses:
.IP "- mmap(2)"
To map the frame buffer memory.
.IP "- ioctl(2)"
To query and update display parameters.
.IP "- termios(3)"
To manipulate terminal I/O modes for raw input.
.IP "- fork(2) and execv(3)"
To launch fingerprint verification processes and to eventually switch user sessions.
.IP "- PAM (pam_start, pam_authenticate, pam_acct_mgmt)"
For secure authentication.
.P
These calls are integrated in a manner that respects both the traditional Unix philosophy and modern
systemd-based session management.

.SH BUGS
While fblogin has been tested on several systems, differences in hardware and driver implementations
(e.g., fbdev vs. DRM/KMS) may result in unpredictable behavior on some platforms. Users are advised
to test thoroughly before deploying fblogin as a replacement for the standard login.
